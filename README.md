# Startup Funding EDA
## Overview
In this project, we analyze startup funding data to gain insights into the funding landscape for startups. We use data analysis techniques in Python, specifically using the pandas and numpy libraries, to clean and wrangle the data, and data visualization techniques to present the key findings. The case study focuses on the problem of initial funding for startups, and aims to provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs and investors.

## Data
The data for this project was obtained from Crunchbase, a platform that tracks funding and other information for startups. The data includes information on the startup company, the funding round, and the investors involved.
